## [0.3.26] - 2022-10-26

### Added

- Support for handling full paths to libraries in addition to normal `-l`
  linker flags (#134).

## [0.3.25] - 2022-03-31

### Added

- Support for parsing `-Wl` linker arguments from the `Libs` lines and
  passing them to the linker as well as making them available via
  `Library::ld_args` (#131).

### Changed

- Use SPDX license format and remove obsolete badge info (#129).

## [0.3.24] - 2021-12-11

### Fixed

- Re-add `target_supported()`, which was accidentally removed in 0.3.15 (#128).

## [0.3.23] - 2021-12-06

### Changed

- Improve error messages when a `pkg-config` package can't be found (#127).

## [0.3.22] - 2021-10-24

### Fixed

- `pkg-config` compiles again with Rust 1.30 or newer. 0.3.21 accidentally
  made use of API only available since 1.40 (#124, #125).

### Changed

- Switched from Travis to GitHub Actions for the CI. Travis is dysfunctional
  since quite some time (#126).

## [0.3.21] - 2021-10-22

### Fixed

- Tests succeed again on macOS (#122).

### Changed

- Improve error message in case of missing pkg-config and provide instructions
  how it can be installed (#121).

## [0.3.20] - 2021-09-25

### Fixed

- Use target-specific pkg-config consistently everywhere (#121, #118).

## [0.3.19] - 2020-10-13

### Added

- Add `README.md` to be displayed on crates.io (#111).

- Support for `-isystem`, `-iquote` and `-idirafter` include flags (#115).

### Changed

- Improve documentation for cross-compilation (#113).

- Allow overriding system root via the `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` or `SYSROOT`
  environment variable (#82).

## [0.3.18] - 2020-07-11

### Fixed

- Use `env::var_os()` almost everywhere to handle non-UTF8 paths in
  environment variables, and also improve error handling around environment
  variable handling (#106).

### Changed

- Default the `env_metadata` build parameter to `true` instead of `false`.
  Whenever a pkg-config related environment variable changes it would make
  sense to rebuild crates that use pkg-config, or otherwise changes might not
  be picked up. As such the previous default didn't make much sense (#105).
