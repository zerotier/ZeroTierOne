//!
//! This library provides a **safe** mechanism for calling C++ code from Rust
//! and Rust code from C++, not subject to the many ways that things can go
//! wrong when using bindgen or cbindgen to generate unsafe C-style bindings.
//!
//! This doesn't change the fact that 100% of C++ code is unsafe. When auditing
//! a project, you would be on the hook for auditing all the unsafe Rust code
//! and *all* the C++ code. The core safety claim under this new model is that
//! auditing just the C++ side would be sufficient to catch all problems, i.e.
//! the Rust side can be 100% safe.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! *Compiler support: requires rustc 1.60+ and c++11 or newer*<br>
//! *[Release notes](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/releases)*
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Guide
//!
//! Please see **<https://cxx.rs>** for a tutorial, reference material, and
//! example code.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The idea is that we define the signatures of both sides of our FFI boundary
//! embedded together in one Rust module (the next section shows an example).
//! From this, CXX receives a complete picture of the boundary to perform static
//! analyses against the types and function signatures to uphold both Rust's and
//! C++'s invariants and requirements.
//!
//! If everything checks out statically, then CXX uses a pair of code generators
//! to emit the relevant `extern "C"` signatures on both sides together with any
//! necessary static assertions for later in the build process to verify
//! correctness. On the Rust side this code generator is simply an attribute
//! procedural macro. On the C++ side it can be a small Cargo build script if
//! your build is managed by Cargo, or for other build systems like Bazel or
//! Buck we provide a command line tool which generates the header and source
//! file and should be easy to integrate.
//!
//! The resulting FFI bridge operates at zero or negligible overhead, i.e. no
//! copying, no serialization, no memory allocation, no runtime checks needed.
//!
//! The FFI signatures are able to use native types from whichever side they
//! please, such as Rust's `String` or C++'s `std::string`, Rust's `Box` or
//! C++'s `std::unique_ptr`, Rust's `Vec` or C++'s `std::vector`, etc in any
//! combination. CXX guarantees an ABI-compatible signature that both sides
//! understand, based on builtin bindings for key standard library types to
//! expose an idiomatic API on those types to the other language. For example
//! when manipulating a C++ string from Rust, its `len()` method becomes a call
//! of the `size()` member function defined by C++; when manipulation a Rust
//! string from C++, its `size()` member function calls Rust's `len()`.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! In this example we are writing a Rust application that wishes to take
//! advantage of an existing C++ client for a large-file blobstore service. The
//! blobstore supports a `put` operation for a discontiguous buffer upload. For
//! example we might be uploading snapshots of a circular buffer which would
//! tend to consist of 2 chunks, or fragments of a file spread across memory for
//! some other reason.
//!
//! A runnable version of this example is provided under the *demo* directory of
//! <https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx>. To try it out, run `cargo run` from that
//! directory.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! #[cxx::bridge]
//! mod ffi {
//!     // Any shared structs, whose fields will be visible to both languages.
//!     struct BlobMetadata {
//!         size: usize,
//!         tags: Vec<String>,
//!     }
//!
//!     extern "Rust" {
//!         // Zero or more opaque types which both languages can pass around but
//!         // only Rust can see the fields.
//!         type MultiBuf;
//!
//!         // Functions implemented in Rust.
//!         fn next_chunk(buf: &mut MultiBuf) -> &[u8];
//!     }
//!
//!     unsafe extern "C++" {
//!         // One or more headers with the matching C++ declarations. Our code
//!         // generators don't read it but it gets #include'd and used in static
//!         // assertions to ensure our picture of the FFI boundary is accurate.
//!         include!("demo/include/blobstore.h");
//!
//!         // Zero or more opaque types which both languages can pass around but
//!         // only C++ can see the fields.
//!         type BlobstoreClient;
//!
//!         // Functions implemented in C++.
//!         fn new_blobstore_client() -> UniquePtr<BlobstoreClient>;
//!         fn put(&self, parts: &mut MultiBuf) -> u64;
//!         fn tag(&self, blobid: u64, tag: &str);
//!         fn metadata(&self, blobid: u64) -> BlobMetadata;
//!     }
//! }
//! #
//! # pub struct MultiBuf;
//! #
//! # fn next_chunk(_buf: &mut MultiBuf) -> &[u8] {
//! #     unimplemented!()
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! Now we simply provide Rust definitions of all the things in the `extern
//! "Rust"` block and C++ definitions of all the things in the `extern "C++"`
//! block, and get to call back and forth safely.
//!
//! Here are links to the complete set of source files involved in the demo:
//!
//! - [demo/src/main.rs](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/blob/master/demo/src/main.rs)
//! - [demo/build.rs](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/blob/master/demo/build.rs)
//! - [demo/include/blobstore.h](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/blob/master/demo/include/blobstore.h)
//! - [demo/src/blobstore.cc](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/blob/master/demo/src/blobstore.cc)
//!
//! To look at the code generated in both languages for the example by the CXX
//! code generators:
//!
//! ```console
//!    # run Rust code generator and print to stdout
//!    # (requires https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand)
//! $ cargo expand --manifest-path demo/Cargo.toml
//!
//!    # run C++ code generator and print to stdout
//! $ cargo run --manifest-path gen/cmd/Cargo.toml -- demo/src/main.rs
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! As seen in the example, the language of the FFI boundary involves 3 kinds of
//! items:
//!
//! - **Shared structs** &mdash; their fields are made visible to both
//!   languages. The definition written within cxx::bridge is the single source
//!   of truth.
//!
//! - **Opaque types** &mdash; their fields are secret from the other language.
//!   These cannot be passed across the FFI by value but only behind an
//!   indirection, such as a reference `&`, a Rust `Box`, or a `UniquePtr`. Can
//!   be a type alias for an arbitrarily complicated generic language-specific
//!   type depending on your use case.
//!
//! - **Functions** &mdash; implemented in either language, callable from the
//!   other language.
//!
//! Within the `extern "Rust"` part of the CXX bridge we list the types and
//! functions for which Rust is the source of truth. These all implicitly refer
//! to the `super` module, the parent module of the CXX bridge. You can think of
//! the two items listed in the example above as being like `use
//! super::MultiBuf` and `use super::next_chunk` except re-exported to C++. The
//! parent module will either contain the definitions directly for simple
//! things, or contain the relevant `use` statements to bring them into scope
//! from elsewhere.
//!
//! Within the `extern "C++"` part, we list types and functions for which C++ is
//! the source of truth, as well as the header(s) that declare those APIs. In
//! the future it's possible that this section could be generated bindgen-style
//! from the headers but for now we need the signatures written out; static
//! assertions will verify that they are accurate.
//!
//! Your function implementations themselves, whether in C++ or Rust, *do not*
//! need to be defined as `extern "C"` ABI or no\_mangle. CXX will put in the
//! right shims where necessary to make it all work.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Comparison vs bindgen and cbindgen
//!
//! Notice that with CXX there is repetition of all the function signatures:
//! they are typed out once where the implementation is defined (in C++ or Rust)
//! and again inside the cxx::bridge module, though compile-time assertions
//! guarantee these are kept in sync. This is different from [bindgen] and
//! [cbindgen] where function signatures are typed by a human once and the tool
//! consumes them in one language and emits them in the other language.
//!
//! [bindgen]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen
//! [cbindgen]: https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/
//!
//! This is because CXX fills a somewhat different role. It is a lower level
//! tool than bindgen or cbindgen in a sense; you can think of it as being a
//! replacement for the concept of `extern "C"` signatures as we know them,
//! rather than a replacement for a bindgen. It would be reasonable to build a
//! higher level bindgen-like tool on top of CXX which consumes a C++ header
//! and/or Rust module (and/or IDL like Thrift) as source of truth and generates
//! the cxx::bridge, eliminating the repetition while leveraging the static
//! analysis safety guarantees of CXX.
//!
//! But note in other ways CXX is higher level than the bindgens, with rich
//! support for common standard library types. Frequently with bindgen when we
//! are dealing with an idiomatic C++ API we would end up manually wrapping that
//! API in C-style raw pointer functions, applying bindgen to get unsafe raw
//! pointer Rust functions, and replicating the API again to expose those
//! idiomatically in Rust. That's a much worse form of repetition because it is
//! unsafe all the way through.
//!
//! By using a CXX bridge as the shared understanding between the languages,
//! rather than `extern "C"` C-style signatures as the shared understanding,
//! common FFI use cases become expressible using 100% safe code.
//!
//! It would also be reasonable to mix and match, using CXX bridge for the 95%
//! of your FFI that is straightforward and doing the remaining few oddball
//! signatures the old fashioned way with bindgen and cbindgen, if for some
//! reason CXX's static restrictions get in the way. Please file an issue if you
//! end up taking this approach so that we know what ways it would be worthwhile
//! to make the tool more expressive.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Cargo-based setup
//!
//! For builds that are orchestrated by Cargo, you will use a build script that
//! runs CXX's C++ code generator and compiles the resulting C++ code along with
//! any other C++ code for your crate.
//!
//! The canonical build script is as follows. The indicated line returns a
//! [`cc::Build`] instance (from the usual widely used `cc` crate) on which you
//! can set up any additional source files and compiler flags as normal.
//!
//! [`cc::Build`]: https://docs.rs/cc/1.0/cc/struct.Build.html
//!
//! ```toml
//! # Cargo.toml
//!
//! [build-dependencies]
//! cxx-build = "1.0"
//! ```
//!
//! ```no_run
//! // build.rs
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     cxx_build::bridge("src/main.rs")  // returns a cc::Build
//!         .file("src/demo.cc")
//!         .flag_if_supported("-std=c++11")
//!         .compile("cxxbridge-demo");
//!
//!     println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/main.rs");
//!     println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/demo.cc");
//!     println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=include/demo.h");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! <br><br>
//!
//! # Non-Cargo setup
//!
//! For use in non-Cargo builds like Bazel or Buck, CXX provides an alternate
//! way of invoking the C++ code generator as a standalone command line tool.
//! The tool is packaged as the `cxxbridge-cmd` crate on crates.io or can be
//! built from the *gen/cmd* directory of <https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx>.
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ cargo install cxxbridge-cmd
//!
//! $ cxxbridge src/main.rs --header > path/to/mybridge.h
//! $ cxxbridge src/main.rs > path/to/mybridge.cc
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Be aware that the design of this library is intentionally restrictive and
//! opinionated! It isn't a goal to be powerful enough to handle arbitrary
//! signatures in either language. Instead this project is about carving out a
//! reasonably expressive set of functionality about which we can make useful
//! safety guarantees today and maybe extend over time. You may find that it
//! takes some practice to use CXX bridge effectively as it won't work in all
//! the ways that you are used to.
//!
//! Some of the considerations that go into ensuring safety are:
//!
//! - By design, our paired code generators work together to control both sides
//!   of the FFI boundary. Ordinarily in Rust writing your own `extern "C"`
//!   blocks is unsafe because the Rust compiler has no way to know whether the
//!   signatures you've written actually match the signatures implemented in the
//!   other language. With CXX we achieve that visibility and know what's on the
//!   other side.
//!
//! - Our static analysis detects and prevents passing types by value that
//!   shouldn't be passed by value from C++ to Rust, for example because they
//!   may contain internal pointers that would be screwed up by Rust's move
//!   behavior.
//!
//! - To many people's surprise, it is possible to have a struct in Rust and a
//!   struct in C++ with exactly the same layout / fields / alignment /
//!   everything, and still not the same ABI when passed by value. This is a
//!   longstanding bindgen bug that leads to segfaults in absolutely
//!   correct-looking code ([rust-lang/rust-bindgen#778]). CXX knows about this
//!   and can insert the necessary zero-cost workaround transparently where
//!   needed, so go ahead and pass your structs by value without worries. This
//!   is made possible by owning both sides of the boundary rather than just
//!   one.
//!
//! - Template instantiations: for example in order to expose a UniquePtr\<T\>
//!   type in Rust backed by a real C++ unique\_ptr, we have a way of using a
//!   Rust trait to connect the behavior back to the template instantiations
//!   performed by the other language.
//!
//! [rust-lang/rust-bindgen#778]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/778
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Builtin types
//!
//! In addition to all the primitive types (i32 &lt;=&gt; int32_t), the
//! following common types may be used in the fields of shared structs and the
//! arguments and returns of functions.
//!
//! <table>
//! <tr><th>name in Rust</th><th>name in C++</th><th>restrictions</th></tr>
//! <tr><td>String</td><td>rust::String</td><td></td></tr>
//! <tr><td>&amp;str</td><td>rust::Str</td><td></td></tr>
//! <tr><td>&amp;[T]</td><td>rust::Slice&lt;const T&gt;</td><td><sup><i>cannot hold opaque C++ type</i></sup></td></tr>

//! <tr><td>*mut T, *const T</td><td>T*, const T*</td><td><sup><i>fn with a raw pointer argument must be declared unsafe to call</i></sup></td></tr>
//! <tr><td>fn(T, U) -&gt; V</td><td>rust::Fn&lt;V(T, U)&gt;</td><td><sup><i>only passing from Rust to C++ is implemented so far</i></sup></td></tr>
//! <tr><td>Result&lt;T&gt;</td><td>throw/catch</td><td><sup><i>allowed as return type only</i></sup></td></tr>
//! </table>
//!
//! The C++ API of the `rust` namespace is defined by the *include/cxx.h* file
//! in <https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx>. You will need to include this header in
//! your C++ code when working with those types.
//!
//! The following types are intended to be supported "soon" but are just not
//! implemented yet. I don't expect any of these to be hard to make work but
//! it's a matter of designing a nice API for each in its non-native language.
