//! Thread-safe, non-blocking, "first one wins" flavor of `OnceCell`.
//!
//! If two threads race to initialize a type from the `race` module, they
//! don't block, execute initialization function together, but only one of
//! them stores the result.
//!
//! This module does not require `std` feature.
//!
//! # Atomic orderings
//!
//! All types in this module use `Acquire` and `Release`
//! [atomic orderings](Ordering) for all their operations. While this is not
//! strictly necessary for types other than `OnceBox`, it is useful for users as
//! it allows them to be certain that after `get` or `get_or_init` returns on
//! one thread, any side-effects caused by the setter thread prior to them
//! calling `set` or `get_or_init` will be made visible to that thread; without
//! it, it's possible for it to appear as if they haven't happened yet from the
//! getter thread's perspective. This is an acceptable tradeoff to make since
//! `Acquire` and `Release` have very little performance overhead on most
//! architectures versus `Relaxed`.
