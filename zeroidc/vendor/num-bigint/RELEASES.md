### Breaking Changes

- Updated public dependences on [arbitrary, quickcheck][194], and [rand][185]:
  - `arbitrary` support has been updated to 1.0, requiring Rust 1.40.
  - `quickcheck` support has been updated to 1.0, requiring Rust 1.46.
  - `rand` support has been updated to 0.8, requiring Rust 1.36.
- [`Debug` now shows plain numeric values for `BigInt` and `BigUint`][195],
  rather than the raw list of internal digits.

# Release 0.3.3 (2021-09-03)

- [Use explicit `Integer::div_ceil` to avoid the new unstable method.][219]

**Contributors**: @catenacyber, @cuviper

# Release 0.3.2 (2021-03-04)

- [The new `BigUint` methods `count_ones` and `trailing_ones`][175] return the
  number of `1` bits in the entire value or just its least-significant tail,
  respectively.
- [The new `BigInt` and `BigUint` methods `bit` and `set_bit`][183] will read
  and write individual bits of the value. For negative `BigInt`, bits are
  determined as if they were in the two's complement representation.
- [The `from_radix_le` and `from_radix_be` methods][187] now accept empty
  buffers to represent zero.
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` can now iterate digits as `u32` or `u64`][192],
  regardless of the actual internal digit size.

# Release 0.3.1 (2020-11-03)

- [Addition and subtraction now uses intrinsics][141] for performance on `x86`
  and `x86_64` when built with Rust 1.33 or later.
- [Conversions `to_f32` and `to_f64` now return infinity][163] for very large
  numbers, rather than `None`. This does preserve the sign too, so a large
  negative `BigInt` will convert to negative infinity.
- [The optional `arbitrary` feature implements `arbitrary::Arbitrary`][166],
  distinct from `quickcheck::Arbitrary`.
- [The division algorithm has been optimized][170] to reduce the number of
  temporary allocations and improve the internal guesses at each step.
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` will opportunistically shrink capacity][171] if the
  internal vector is much larger than needed.

# Release 0.3.0 (2020-06-12)

### Enhancements

- [The internal `BigDigit` may now be either `u32` or `u64`][62], although that
  implementation detail is not exposed in the API. For now, this is chosen to
  match the target pointer size, but may change in the future.
- [No-`std` is now supported with the `alloc` crate on Rust 1.36][101].
- [`Pow` is now implemented for bigint values][137], not just references.
- [`TryFrom` is now implemented on Rust 1.34 and later][123], converting signed
  integers to unsigned, and narrowing big integers to primitives.
- [`Shl` and `Shr` are now implemented for a variety of shift types][142].
- A new `trailing_zeros()` returns the number of consecutive zeros from the
  least significant bit.
- The new `BigInt::magnitude` and `into_parts` methods give access to its
  `BigUint` part as the magnitude.

### Breaking Changes

- `num-bigint` now requires Rust 1.31 or greater.
  - The "i128" opt-in feature was removed, now always available.
- [Updated public dependences][110]:
  - `rand` support has been updated to 0.7, requiring Rust 1.32.
  - `quickcheck` support has been updated to 0.9, requiring Rust 1.34.
- [Removed `impl Neg for BigUint`][145], which only ever panicked.
- [Bit counts are now `u64` instead of `usize`][143].

# Release 0.2.4 (2020-01-01)

- [The new `BigUint::to_u32_digits` method][104] returns the number as a
  little-endian vector of base-2<sup>32</sup> digits. The same method on
  `BigInt` also returns the sign.
- [`BigUint::modpow` now applies a modulus even for exponent 1][113], which
  also affects `BigInt::modpow`.
- [`BigInt::modpow` now returns the correct sign for negative bases with even
  exponents][114].

# Release 0.2.3 (2019-09-03)

# Release 0.2.2 (2018-12-14)

- [The `Roots` implementations now use better initial guesses][71].
- [Fixed `to_signed_bytes_*` for some positive numbers][72], where the
  most-significant byte is `0x80` and the rest are `0`.

**Contributors**: @cuviper, @leodasvacas

# Release 0.2.1 (2018-11-02)

- [`RandBigInt` now uses `Rng::fill_bytes`][53] to improve performance, instead
  of repeated `gen::<u32>` calls.  The also affects the implementations of the
  other `rand` traits.  This may potentially change the values produced by some
  seeded RNGs on previous versions, but the values were tested to be stable
  with `ChaChaRng`, `IsaacRng`, and `XorShiftRng`.
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement `num_integer::Roots`][56].
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement `num_traits::Pow`][54].
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement operators with 128-bit integers][64].

# Release 0.2.0 (2018-05-25)

### Enhancements

- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement `Product` and `Sum`][22] for iterators
  of any item that we can `Mul` and `Add`, respectively.  For example, a
  factorial can now be simply: `let f: BigUint = (1u32..1000).product();`
- [`BigInt` now supports two's-complement logic operations][26], namely
  `BitAnd`, `BitOr`, `BitXor`, and `Not`.  These act conceptually as if each
  number had an infinite prefix of `0` or `1` bits for positive or negative.
- [`BigInt` now supports assignment operators][41] like `AddAssign`.
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now support conversions with `i128` and `u128`][44],
  if sufficient compiler support is detected.
- [`BigInt` and `BigUint` now implement rand's `SampleUniform` trait][48], and
  [a custom `RandomBits` distribution samples by bit size][49].
- The release also includes other miscellaneous improvements to performance.

### Breaking Changes

- [`num-bigint` now requires rustc 1.15 or greater][23].
- [The crate now has a `std` feature, and won't build without it][46].  This is
  in preparation for someday supporting `#![no_std]` with `alloc`.
- [The `serde` dependency has been updated to 1.0][24], still disabled by
  default.  The `rustc-serialize` crate is no longer supported by `num-bigint`.
- [The `rand` dependency has been updated to 0.5][48], now disabled by default.
  This requires rustc 1.22 or greater for `rand`'s own requirement.
- [`Shr for BigInt` now rounds down][8] rather than toward zero, matching the
  behavior of the primitive integers for negative values.
- [`ParseBigIntError` is now an opaque type][37].
- [The `big_digit` module is no longer public][38], nor are the `BigDigit` and
  `DoubleBigDigit` types and `ZERO_BIG_DIGIT` constant that were re-exported in
  the crate root.  Public APIs which deal in digits, like `BigUint::from_slice`,
  will now always be base-`u32`.

# Release 0.1.43 (2018-02-08)
