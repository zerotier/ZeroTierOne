 *  (4) Remote address
 *  (5) Packet data
 *  (6) Packet length
 *  (7) Desired IP TTL or 0 to use default
 *
 * If there is only one local socket, the local socket can be ignored.
 * If the local socket is -1, the packet should be sent out from all
 * bound local sockets or a random bound local socket.
 *
 * If TTL is nonzero, packets should have their IP TTL value set to this
 * value if possible. If this is not possible it is acceptable to ignore
 * this value and send anyway with normal or default TTL.
 *
 * The function must return zero on success and may return any error code
 * on failure. Note that success does not (of course) guarantee packet
 * delivery. It only means that the packet appears to have been sent.
