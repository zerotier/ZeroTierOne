tetanus: work-in-progress repo for ZeroTier v2
======

![Rust](artwork/rust.png)

This repository contains the work-in-progress ZeroTier v2 code base, which is implemented in (almost) pure Rust.

DO NOT expect this code to work or be useful for anything yet. Also note that it does not yet have an open source license. We are planning on licensing it under one when it's released, but for now it's just copyright ZeroTier. (We're considering the MPL and a few other options.)

Eventually the plan is that this repository will be merged back into the main repo as a branch and then this branch will become the new release, replacing the current v1 code base. Until then, feel free to look around.

Once again: do not expect this to be done and do not try to post bug reports about it. It's very much under construction.
